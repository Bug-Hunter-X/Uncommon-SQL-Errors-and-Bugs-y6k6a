In SQL, a common error is using the wrong data type for a column, which can lead to unexpected results or data truncation.  For example, if you store a large number in a column with a too-small integer type, it might get truncated or result in an overflow error.  Another issue is improper use of indexes.  While indexes speed up queries, using them inefficiently can slow down data insertion and update operations. Also, incorrect JOIN conditions can result in unexpected results or incorrect query results, especially in complex queries involving multiple tables.  Finally, overlooking NULL values can lead to unexpected behaviors in comparisons and calculations. If your WHERE clause is missing a check for NULL values it can lead to wrong results.
