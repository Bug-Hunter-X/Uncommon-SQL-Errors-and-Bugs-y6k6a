This repository contains examples of uncommon SQL errors and their solutions.  The `bug.sql` file demonstrates typical mistakes, while `bugSolution.sql` offers corrected versions.  This is aimed at helping developers understand and avoid potential issues in database design and querying.  The focus is on issues beyond simple syntax errors, encompassing data type handling, indexing, joins, and NULL considerations.   Common errors, like syntax issues, are not explicitly addressed since they are readily identified by most IDEs and linters.
